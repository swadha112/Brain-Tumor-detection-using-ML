This project focuses on brain tumor detection from MRI images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model based on the VGG16 architecture. The goal is to classify images into two categories: Yes (tumor present) and No (no tumor). The project involves preprocessing the data, augmenting images, training the model, and evaluating its performance.
